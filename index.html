                        <p>The Oliver &amp; Oliver story begins with Juanillo Oliver in the mid-nineteenth century. A Catalan in the Spanish military, Juanillo ended his military service in 1868 and established himself in the idyllic Las Placetas in Cuba. He and his family cultivated tobacco and sugarcane, and soon expanded their operations into the milling and production of sugars and tobaccos for the local farmers. Before long Juanillo was creating locally sourced, artisanal rums and cigars. Before long, the Oliver name was synonymous with the production of remarkable Cuban rum.</p>
                        <p>The War of Independence would put an end to the fame that had enveloped the Oliver family. Farms were destroyed, and the iconic Oliver mills were razed in 1898. Juanillo returned to his farmland where he rebuilt his sugar and tobacco crops, and his family continued that tradition until Cuba was once again shaken by revolution.</p>

                        <p>The Ron Cubaney range of rums were created through conflict and revived through passion.</p>
                        <p>War brought Juanillo Oliver to Cuba. It was conflict that saw the original Oliver & Oliver distilleries destroyed and it was conflict that saw the Oliver family scattered throughout the Americas and the Caribbean.</p>
                        <p>In 1987 that passion drew the Oliver family back to Cuba. It was that passion that saw the family uncover its heritage.</p>

                        <p>Aged for more than 8 years in small oak casks and aged in wine vaults of high Carribean temperatures, this is one of the best commercial rums.</p>
                        <p>It is a sweet and thick rum of taste and character, it is long in flavour, which allows it to be felt with a few sweet short notes. Dry with a colour old bronze, with a natural, very brilliant texture, it is an excellent rum to drink neat. </p>

                        <span class="sub-heading">the journey</span>
                        <p>It was passion that also saw Ron Cubaney reach Australian shores.</p>
                        <p>Justin Boseley had zig-zagged the world working alongside oligarchs and billionaires.<br/>It gave him the opportunity to discover his own refinements. It wasn’t caviar or couture which attracted his interest. Instead, it was rum that sparked his passion. Justin was soon scouring the Caribbean for it’s most delectable, refined, unique creations. He’d fallen to the enchantment of its rich history and flavour like so many before.</p>
                        <p>Justin’s journey often ended with disappointment. Too often local distilleries had given into the temptation of the money offered by global beverage corporations.<br/>Words like ‘aroma’, ‘aged’ and ‘full-bodied ’ were smothered by concepts like ‘margin’, ‘revenue’ and ‘efficiency’. </p>
                        <p>It was then that Justin discovered the story of Oliver &amp; Oliver; traditional rum distillers, re-establishing their Cuban heritage in the idyllic geographic and cultural surrounds of the Dominican Republic. Their Ron Cubaney range of traditional Cuban styled rums had been created by a Spanish soldier over 150 years before, were almost lost during the revolutions of the 1890s and the 1950s, and were now being reimagined by his descendants.  </p>
